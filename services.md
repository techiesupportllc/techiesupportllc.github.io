At the moment, we offer one service specifically:  IT content writing.

# Who we produce content for

I work with companies in the IT industry.  This includes one-man IT consulting companies, MSPs with multiple employees and even individual software and hardware vendors.

# What kind of content we produce

My primary focus is on high-quality written word pieces.  These could be for your blog, specific landing pages on your website or even promotional whitepapers that you send out to potential customers.

That said, I do have some light graphic design experience.  If a piece calls for it, I can often produce some simple visuals to accompany it, such as captioned images or even infographics.

# When will we finish your content

Every project is a bit different from the next.  However, I generally complete most content pieces within five business days and oftentimes less.

When we go over the specific details of your project, I'll be able to give you a more accurate timeline.

# Why work with us

You could almost literally throw a rock and hit three or four content writers.  So you're likely wondering what makes me and my (only slightly) exhorbitant rates worth it.

The truth is, I'm not a great fit for everyone.  If you're just looking for some cheap listicles or fluff articles to pad out your affiliate marketing website, Upwork and Fiverr are probably right up your alley.

But if your company exists within the IT space and you're looking for top-notch content, I'm your man.

I combine over four years' experience working as an IT consultant and technician with over two years' experience as a salesperson.  Then, I mix in my strong English background (honors program in college) with the numerous marketing courses I've taken (including HubSpot's Content Marketing certification).

The end result for you is a content writer who understands how to effectively communicate with both the technicians responsible for working directly with technology and the end users who just want things explained in easy terms.
