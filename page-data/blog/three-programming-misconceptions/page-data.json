We've met our fair share of stubborn people, and you probably have too.  You might even be one of them!</p>\n<p>But why is stubbornnes important for programming?  Because it isn't something you learn overnight.  As a matter of fact, you won't even master it after spending several years attending university classes.  Instead, it's an ongoing craft that's honed and perfected on a daily basis.  All along the way you're going to run into inevitable problems that you'll need to doggedly push through.</p>\n<p>The weak will give up, but <em>the stubborn will keep going</em>.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<p>Thankfully, we all have enough stubbornness in us to learn programming.  If you're fired up and ready to start learning, check out these three amazing resources for help:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>.  This site will allow you to learn common languages like <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> and give you some challenging projects to work on.  You can even earn certifications to boost your resume or brag to your friends.  Best of all, it's all <em>100% free</em>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a>.  This site offers training in a wider array of languages, such as <strong>Python</strong>.  There aren't any certifications to earn, but it's still a solid resource that you should check out.

You should be expecting this by now, but this one is also <em>100% free</em>!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the right resources and enough stubbornness (maybe <em>persistence</em> is a better word choice), anyone can learn programming.  If you've been thinking about taking the plunge, there's no better time than the present.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Three Programming Misconceptions","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.49800796812749,"src":"/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/bc3a8/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/d278e/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg 200w,\n/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/8539d/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg 400w,\n/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/bc3a8/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg 800w,\n/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/81ef8/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg 1200w,\n/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/989b1/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg 1600w,\n/static/5d723e920d7c9623e7e1771f666a2a41/ea5d4/three-programming-misconceptions.jpg 6016w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/three-programming-misconceptions/"}}}
