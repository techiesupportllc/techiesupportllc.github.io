It seems like there are about 100,000 different options out there.  Every one of them says they’re the best, the cheapest, the fastest, you name it.  Maybe you ask a tech-savvy friend for some advice.  What do they tell you?</p>\n<p><em>“Just use WordPress.”</em></p>\n<h2>The Situation</h2>\n<p>It’s true; a massive percentage of business websites use WordPress.  We can make some educated guesses as to why this is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress has great brand recognition.</li>\n<li>Every web developer is at least familiar with it.</li>\n<li>It has a ton of available themes and extensions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, so good.</p>\n<p>We’re not bashing WordPress or saying that it absolutely <em>shouldn’t</em> be used ever.  But it does have its fair share of drawbacks.  Ultimately, these boil down to <strong>poor speed</strong> and <strong>lackluster security</strong>.  Before the WordPress fans converge on us, it’s worth pointing out that these issues can be mitigated with the right combination of hosting, content delivery and extensions — emphasis on <em>can be</em>.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we’ve observed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Businesses often hire web developers based solely on price, and those developers are often lacking experience in the optimal way to set up WordPress.</li>\n<li>A large majority of businesses opt not to pay their web developer to maintain their WordPress site, and they rarely take the time to do so themselves.</li>\n<li>Most business websites go months or years between updates, and they’re essentially online “brochures” advertising the business’ services.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Better Way</h2>\n<p>We won’t touch WordPress with a 10-foot pole, as the old saying goes.  Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Because there’s a better way.</strong></p>\n<p>We build our sites using cutting-edge technologies and modern workflows — the <em>JAMstack</em>.  This translates to a smoother, faster and more efficient development process which in turn correlates to better performance, lower cost and greater scalability for your website.</p>\n<p>It’s a bold move in the web development community to completely avoid WordPress projects.  But it’s part of what makes us <strong>radically different</strong> from the competition.  And ultimately, we do it because we firmly believe it’s in your best interests to do so.</p>\n<p>So please, <em>don’t</em> just use WordPress.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Should You Just Use WordPress?","date":"2019-07-22","description":"This is common advice, but is it the right move for your business?","tags":["wordpress","jamstack"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/just-use-wordpress/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","tags":["history"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/programming-misconceptions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Three Programming Misconceptions","tags":["programming"]}}}}}
