We’ve met our fair share of stubborn people, and you probably have too.  You might even be one of them!</p>\n<p>But why is stubbornnes important for programming?  Because it isn’t something you learn overnight.  As a matter of fact, you won’t even master it after spending several years attending university classes.  Instead, it’s an ongoing craft that’s honed and perfected on a daily basis.  All along the way you’re going to run into inevitable problems that you’ll need to doggedly push through.</p>\n<p>The weak will give up, but <em>the stubborn will keep going</em>.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<p>Thankfully, we all have enough stubbornness in us to learn programming.  If you’re fired up and ready to start learning, check out these three amazing resources for help:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>.
