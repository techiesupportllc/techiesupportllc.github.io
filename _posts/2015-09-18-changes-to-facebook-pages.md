Facebook has announced some changes to its Pages feature that will be of particular interest to businesses using the service. Businesses will now be able to designate their Page as Shopping or Services. Shopping will allow retailers to sell products directly from their Facebook Page, whereas Services will allow service-based companies to highlight the various services they offer.
