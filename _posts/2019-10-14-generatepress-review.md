We’ve used a lot of WordPress themes over the years including popular themes like Astra and Divi. Now we only use GeneratePress. We’ll cover why in our detailed review below.

## What is GeneratePress?

Tom Usborne is a WordPress developer from Canada. He’s also the creator of the GeneratePress theme. It is a lightweight, fast and clean theme that comes in both free and paid versions. Don’t take our word for it. The theme currently has hundreds of five-star reviews in the official WordPress repository.

We started out with the free version of GeneratePress and fell in love with it. It didn’t take us long to buy the paid version.

## A Detailed Look at GeneratePress

A fresh GeneratePress install on Cloudways WordPress hosting loads in about 275 milliseconds. That’s fast.

Tom has put in a lot of hard work to make every file in GeneratePress as small as possible. It’s the same with all the premium add-ons. They’re all as small as they be. He definitely cares about performance.

### No Child Theme Necessary

You won’t need to use a child theme with GeneratePress. The Hooks premium add-on allows you to add custom code anywhere throughout your site. This customization won’t get lost when you update the theme. Tom also has a public repository of code snippets you can use. They’re all designed for GeneratePress.

### Customization Options

You have several options on each post and page. The page width and sidebar layout are customizable along with the footer widgets. You can also disable specific page or post elements like the title and menu.

Within the WordPress Customizer you can adjust the container width, spacing and padding. You can change font families, sizes and weights as well. Your blog post featured image layout is also adjustable.

### Using Sections

The premium Sections add-on expands your layout options. It’s almost a miniature page builder right inside of the theme. Full page builders like Elementor often add a bit of slow down to a site. Sections maintains the full performance you’d expect from GeneratePress.

## Recapping the GeneratePress Review

It’s fast and lightweight. It works great with every plugin we’ve tried. It’s clean and responsive. It’s customizable. The base version is 100% free, and the paid version is affordable for almost all budgets. In a nutshell, if you’re using WordPress, you owe it to yourself to give GeneratePress a try.
