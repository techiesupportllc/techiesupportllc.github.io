What comes to mind when you hear the word programmer?  Is it a nerdy guy in glasses who loves [**Battlestar Galactica**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica) a bit too much?  Maybe you picture [**Wayne Knight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Knight) as Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park.

There are three big misconceptions about programming:

1. **You have to be great at math.**
2. **You have to be a genius.**
3. **You have to get a bachelor's degree in computer science.**

Wrong!

Programming is all about being stubborn.  I don't know about you, but I've met a lot of stubborn people in my life.  So it's fair to say that you might be one of them.  If you are, congratulations!  You're qualified to be a programmer.

In all seriousness, though, there's a reason why I say that.  It's because programming isn't something you learn overnight.  It isn't something you master in the 4 years you might spend in a university.  It's an ongoing craft that's honed and perfected each day.

You have to be stubborn to be a programmer because you have to push through the inevitable problems.  You have to be willing to do research on your own to figure out why that piece of code isn't doing what it's supposed to do.

This is my opinion, but anyone can be a programmer.  Even you.  Even me.

Did my pep talk work?

If you're fired up and ready to start learning, here are three awesome resources that'll help you:

1. [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  This site is awesome.  It teaches you common languages like **HTML** and **CSS** and gives you projects to work on to build your portfolio.  You can also earn certifications to boost your resume and link up with nonprofits who need your help.  Best of all, it's all *100% free*!
2. [**Codecademy**](https://www.codecademy.com/).  This site is a close second.  It has a wider array of languages you can learn, such as **Python** and **SQL**.  There aren't any certifications to earn which is unfortunate.  It's still a solid resource that you should check out, though.  Again, it's all *100% free*!
3. [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  This site has a fantastic curriculum covering web development including **Ruby** and databases.  It also has a complete section covering how to get hired as a programmer.  You should be expecting this by now, but this one is also *100% free*!

To recap, anyone can learn programming with enough persistence and the right resources.  If you've been thinking about taking the plunge, there's no better time than the present.
