There are a ton of WordPress hosting companies. Many of them are almost identical. Cloudways is different and offers a unique approach to the service.

## An Overview of Cloudways

They have their headquarters in Malta. What sets them apart from most of their competition is the platforms they use. They build their WordPress hosting on top of five cloud providers. These include Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Linode and Vultr.

You can create accounts with any of these companies yourself. Cloudways adds their server management to the equation to make things easier for you. Their dashboard allows you to spin up new WordPress installs in minutes. This includes performance optimizations that would otherwise need manual setup.

Hosting gets billed in a pay-as-you-go model. This means you only pay for the amount of time your WordPress server is online. It’s affordable even for businesses with limited hosting budgets.

## Cloudways Features

Everything from SSL certificate installations to backups is easy within their online dashboard. Some key features include:

### Dashboard

The Cloudways dashboard is easy to use and mobile responsive. It’s split into several sections encompassing your Applications, Projects, Servers and Teams.

#### Applications

After you spin up a new server with Cloudways, you can add one or more WordPress installations. Each installation has several tabs that allow you to manage different aspects of it.

One nice feature is that each installation gets a temporary URL from Cloudways. This is great for building and staging purposes.

Another convenient feature is free SSL certificate installation from Let’s Encrypt. This also includes automatic certificate renewal.

If you do need to restore from a backup, there’s a dedicated tab for that as well.

#### Servers

Each server gets its own set of tabs. These allow you to see things like your administrator credentials and resource usage.

There’s a dedicated tab showing all services running on the server. Each service has convenient buttons to restart, start or stop it.

Another tab allows you to change PHP and MySQL settings.

A security tab gives you the ability to block IP addresses from accessing your server.

The backup tab controls your server’s backup schedule. This runs once per day by default but can run every hour if you choose.

Finally, there’s a tab that lets you configure what your server uses to send outbound emails.

#### Teams

In this section of the dashboard you can add other members of your team. This gives them access to your server and applications with the appropriate permissions.

### Caching

Cloudways publishes their own WordPress caching plugin called Breeze. It provides several performance optimizations. Also, it supports their content delivery network called CloudwaysCDN.

CloudwaysCDN speeds up your site by caching it on different servers around the world. You can add it to your site with a single click in the dashboard although it does cost a small monthly fee.

If you prefer to use Cloudflare’s CDN instead, you can do so with Cloudways.

### Scaling

You can upgrade your server at any time with a couple of clicks in the dashboard. Downgrading is also possible.

### Support

You’ll have access to live chat support 24 hours a day. In our experience, most issues get a quick resolution through chat. If needed, you can submit a ticket via email or request a phone call. There’s also a community forum available for support.

## Cloudways Pricing

Cloudways offers flexible pay-as-you-go pricing plans. The cheapest plans run on DigitalOcean and Linode. They’re likely good enough for most WordPress sites. If you have a site that gets heavy traffic, you may want to consider their AWS or Google Cloud plans.

They offer a free trial so that you can try before you buy. You won’t even need to enter a credit card to get started. Keep in mind that the trial is only available for the DigitalOcean, Linode and Vultr plans.

You’ll only pay for what you need, and you won’t get locked into any kind of contract term with any of their plans. You can start small and then scale your server up as needed.

Viable payments methods include all major credit cards as well as PayPal.
