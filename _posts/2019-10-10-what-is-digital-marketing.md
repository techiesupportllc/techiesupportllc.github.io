Digital marketing is advertising delivered through digital channels.  These could be social media, mobile and web applications, email and search engines.  They could also be websites or any new digital channel. It is any form of marketing that involves electronic devices.

## Digital Marketing Matters for Your Business

Do you remember billboards?  They’re dead. Google and Facebook generate more revenue because they control more eyeballs.  That’s why digital marketing matters. It’s where the attention is at.

The next time you’re driving with a friend in the passenger seat, take a look at them.  There’s a good chance they’ll be looking at their phone. People are even on their phones while driving!  

The number of people spending time using electronic devices is only increasing.  Most Americans spend over 11 hours on them every day.

## An Overview of Digital Marketing

The seven main categories of digital marketing are:

1. Search Engine Optimization, or SEO
2. Search Engine Marketing, or SEM
3. Content Marketing
4. Social Media Marketing, or SMM
5. Pay-Per-Click Advertising, or PPC
6. Affiliate Marketing
7. Email Marketing

There are also four more categories of digital marketing that takes place offline.

First, there’s enhanced offline marketing.  This is marketing that is offline but enhanced with electronic devices.  For instance, some restaurants have their customers use tablets to place their orders.  The offline experience of eating gets enhanced by the electronic device.

Next, there are radio marketing and TV marketing.  These have been around for decades at this point.

Finally, the fastest growing area of offline marketing is phone marketing.

### Examples of Enhanced Offline Marketing

What do you see in an Apple Store?  You’ll usually see people leaning over iPhones and MacBooks.  This is an example of a product demo. It’s an important part of your digital marketing strategy if you sell electronics.

Another example of enhanced offline marketing would be digital product samples.  Years ago these took the form of game demo or computer software discs that came with magazines.  Nowadays they take the form of musicians handing out CDs or USB sticks to get you to listen to their music.

### Examples of Radio Marketing

Radio still exists, and it still matters.  It reaches 85% of the U.S. population each week.  People listen an average of two hours per day. So, it isn’t dead yet.

Some business owners find a local radio station, get on a show and do an interview.  With a premium time slot, this can be a great way to market your business.

### Examples of TV Marketing

TV marketing may never go away.  Yet, ever since the birth of YouTube the effectiveness of TV ads has declined.  This is true even though the average American watches four hours of TV every day.

TV ads aren’t specific.  You never know who you’ll reach.  Instead, you only know how many people will see your ad.

Even with this in mind, TV ads aren’t dead yet.  There’s still one type worth running. A 60-second Super Bowl commercial will cost $4 million or more, but it will usually pay for itself.

That’s because people love to share Super Bowl ads on social media.  In fact, they account for about 10% of all commercial-related sharing.  They also bring in roughly 8% of YouTube views related to commercials.

These commercials also have the highest retention rate for TV ads.  Over 50% of people asked were able to remember them.

All that said, the success of Super Bowl commercials is about to fade.  Most businesses will also never be able to afford one. You’re better off spending your time and money elsewhere.

### Examples of Phone Marketing

Smartphones are important.  Over 80% of internet users own one.  More people access the internet from their phone instead of their computer.

Even without an internet connection, every phone can call and text.  There are some forms of offline phone marketing that take advantage of this fact.

One of these is cold calling.  It’s the act of calling someone without any prior contact and trying to sell them something.  Nobody likes it, and it isn’t easy to scale.

A better option is text marketing.  That is, assuming that you’re able to get permission first.  Text messages are almost guaranteed to get read. In fact, text messages get opened 98% of the time.  In 90% of cases, they get opened within three minutes of arriving.

Texting special deals is a fantastic way for restaurants to get more customers.  Using text reminders is great for service businesses like salons and massage therapists.  They can promote giveaways as well.

## A Recap of Digital Marketing

The internet isn’t the only place to market your business.  Yet, you also can’t afford to miss out on online marketing.

Try putting some of these offline marketing tactics to use in your own business.  They can diversify your lead generation efforts.

To sum up, the 11 categories of digital marketing are:

### Online Marketing

1. SEO
2. SEM
3. Content Marketing
4. SMM
5. PPC
6. Affiliate Marketing
7. Email Marketing

### Offline Marketing

1. Enhanced Offline Marketing
2. Radio Marketing
3. TV Marketing
4. Phone Marketing

Digital marketing consists of more than running ads on Google.  It’s more than blasting our your promotion on social media.
