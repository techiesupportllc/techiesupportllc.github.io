# Who we are

At the moment, we're one man:  Ben Gilstrap.  

# What we do  

Most businesses don't have the time or manpower to produce content for their websites regularly.  They often turn to content writers to produce this content for them.

There are thousands of content writers available for hire online.  However, not many of them have hands-on knowledge and experience specific to the IT industry.

That's where I come in.  I combine my years of experience in IT with my ability as a writer to produce quality content for your IT-related business.

# When we started

I founded the company in 2013.

# Where we be

I'm located in sunny Phoenix, Arizona.

# Why we exist

Content is like the currency of the internet these days.  There is a massive need for businesses to regularly produce quality content for their websites.

Huge corporations often have teams of people on staff to do this for them.  However, many small to midsize businesses don't have that kind of manpower.

I decided to step in and fill the need for high-quality outsourced IT content for businesses like these.
