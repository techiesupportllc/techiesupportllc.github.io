At the moment, it's just me:  Ben Gilstrap.

Most IT companies don't have the time or manpower to produce content regularly.  They often turn to writers to produce this content for them.

There are thousands of content writers available for hire online.  However, not many of them have hands-on knowledge and experience specific to the IT industry.

That's where I come in.  I combine my years of experience in IT with my writing ability to produce expert, exquisitely crafted and effective content for your IT company.

I founded the company in 2013 in sunny Phoenix, Arizona, as an IT consulting business and worked with small to midsize businesses for the next four years either as their sole IT provider or as a subcontractor for other MSPs and IT firms.

Content is almost like the "currency" of the internet these days.  There's a massive need for IT companies to regularly put out quality content.

Huge corporate IT firms often have teams of people on staff to do this.  However, many small to midsize IT companies don't have that luxury.

I decided to pivot my own business to step in and fill the need for high-quality outsourced IT content for companies like these.
