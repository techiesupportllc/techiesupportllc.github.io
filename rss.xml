&lt;p&gt;If you’re a business owner, picking the right platform for your website is confusing.  It seems like there are about 100,000 different options out there.  Every one of them says they’re the best, the cheapest, the fastest, you name it.  Maybe you ask a tech-savvy friend for some advice.  What do they tell you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Just use WordPress.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true; a massive percentage of business websites use WordPress.  We can make some educated guesses as to why this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordPress has great brand recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every web developer is at least familiar with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a ton of available themes and extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not bashing WordPress or saying that it absolutely &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be used ever.  But it does have its fair share of drawbacks.  Ultimately, these boil down to &lt;strong&gt;poor speed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lackluster security&lt;/strong&gt;.  Before the WordPress fans converge on us, it’s worth pointing out that these issues can be mitigated with the right combination of hosting, content delivery and extensions — emphasis on &lt;em&gt;can be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ve observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses often hire web developers based solely on price, and those developers are often lacking experience in the optimal way to set up WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large majority of businesses opt not to pay their web developer to maintain their WordPress site, and they rarely take the time to do so themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most business websites go months or years between updates, and they’re essentially online “brochures” advertising the business’ services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Better Way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t touch WordPress with a 10-foot pole, as the old saying goes.  Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because there’s a better way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build our sites using cutting-edge technologies and modern workflows — the &lt;em&gt;JAMstack&lt;/em&gt;.  This translates to a smoother, faster and more efficient development process which in turn correlates to better performance, lower cost and greater scalability for your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bold move in the web development community to completely avoid WordPress projects.  But it’s part of what makes us &lt;strong&gt;radically different&lt;/strong&gt; from the competition.  And ultimately, we do it because we firmly believe it’s in your best interests to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; just use WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Harsh Reality After a long hiatus, Techie Support is back!

&lt;p&gt;After a long hiatus, Techie Support is back!  We were founded back in 2013 to provide (perhaps a little too) affordable IT support services for small businesses.  That led to modest success in the local Phoenix market, but here’s the reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you stand in the middle of the road, you get ran over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were too focused on trying to do everything under the sun instead of focusing on specializing and getting really, really, ridiculously good at one specific area of IT.  And when you have a small team, you can’t realistically compete with the big boys who have the resources and manpower to devote to doing a lot of things pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bright Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we took a break, regrouped and refocused on web development.  But folks, we don’t do just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; web development here.  We do &lt;strong&gt;radically different&lt;/strong&gt; web development.  It’s going to be a fun run.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
