**Our pricing is simple and straightforward.**

All content we write is billed at a flat rate of $1 per word.  Once we settle on a specification for your piece of content and the contract has been signed, you'll be required to pay 50% up front.

After the content is finished, the final file will be delivered to you along with the invoice for the remaining amount due.  All invoices are due upon receipt.

We won't perform any work without a signed contract.  However, our contract is designed to be easy to read, simple and clear with no "gotchas".
