## You Can Laugh At Money Worriesâ€”If You Follow This Simple Marketing Plan That Earned U.S. Businesses $1.798 Trillion In A Single Year

This piece of content was written for a direct response marketing agency.  It extolls the virtues of direct response marketing as compared to brand awareness marketing.  It was designed from the start using sound and time-tested copywriting principles as outlined in *How to Write a Good Advertisement* by Victor Schwab (famous for, among other things, the marketing behind Dale Carnegie's popular book *How to Win Friends and Influence People*).

It was to be placed on a special landing page on their website and used to convert casual visitors into leads that could be re-marketed to via email.  The "lead magnet" being used was the Marketing Blueprint mentioned that was offered as a digital download immediately after signing up to the email list.
