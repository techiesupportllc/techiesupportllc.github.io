      <h2>What will we do for you?</h2>
      <p>We'll provide you with <b>premium US-based</b> web development at a <b>fraction of the cost</b> of hiring a full-time web developer.  Your site will be <b>fast, secure and clean</b>.</p>
      <h2>Why will you choose us?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You want <b>premium quality</b></li>
        <li>You want a <b>US-based company</b></li>
        <li>You want a <b>more affordable</b> option than hiring a full-time web developer</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How much will we cost you?</h2>
      <p>You'll receive all of the above benefits for a <b>flat monthly rate of $599</b>.  No upcharges, no nickel and diming, no headaches.</p>
      <h3>Why do we cost so much?</h3>
      <h4>Here's the short answer:</h4>
      <p><b>We don't.</b></p>
      <h4>Here's the long answer:</h4>
      <p>You could <b>roll the dice on hiring some cheap overseas labor</b> to build your site -- maybe from a marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr.  But if you aren't sure what to look for and you don't have the time to properly vet those freelancers, <b>you're going to have a poor experience more often than not</b>.</p>
      <p>You could <b>take a chance on hiring a full-time web developer</b> to build your site -- maybe with an ad on Craigslist.  But then you have to <b>provide equipment and benefits</b>, not to mention needing to <b>manage a new employee</b>.</p>
      <p>You could <b>save yourself time, money and hassle by hiring us</b> to build your site.  There's <b>no vetting for you to waste your time doing</b>.  There's <b>no expensive equipment or benefits for you to waste money providing</b>.  There's <b>no PTO or other headaches for you to waste brainpower managing</b>.</p>
      <p>To top it off, <b>you'll only spend what it would cost you to hire a part-time employee at the federal minimum wage</b>.  And let's be realistic -- <b>you're not going to get premium-quality talent by hiring minimum-wage employees</b>.</p>
      <h2>How long will it take us to build your site?</h2>
      <p>Most sites take <b>between one and three months</b> to build from start to finish.</p>
      <h2>Why will you continue to pay us monthly after your site is built?</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to <b>build long-term relationships with our clients</b>.  Therefore, <b>the benefits you receive</b> by hiring us <b>don't stop when your site is done</b>.  Your monthly cost also includes <b>blazing fast hosting</b> along with an <b>SSL certificate</b> to keep your site secure.  In addition, you'll continue to receive <b>ongoing maintenance and support</b> for any tweaks you'd like to make to your site.</p>
