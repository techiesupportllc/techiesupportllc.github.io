      <p>It's <b>unusual</b>, <b>unique</b> and unquestionably <b>memorable</b> -- just like us.</p>
      <h2>What can we do for you?</h2>
      <p>We'll <b>build</b>, <b>host</b> and <b>maintain</b> your website or web app.</p>
      <p>And we'll do it all for one <b>low monthly cost</b>.</p>
      <h3>How affordable are we?</h3>
      <p>We're <b>light years more affordable</b> than hiring a full-time web developer.</p>
      <p>If you could hire <b>one full-time developer at minimum wage</b>, you'd still be <b>paying more than $1200 per month</b> in wages, taxes and benefits.</p>
      <p>Then, you'd have to deal with all the <b>headaches</b> that come with <b>hiring</b>, <b>training</b> and <b>managing</b> a new employee.</p>
      <p>(<i>But let's face it, <b>no skilled developer</b> is going to work for minimum wage.</i>)</p>
      <h4>With us, it's simple.</h4>
      <p>You pay one flat rate of <b>$999 per month</b>.</p>
      <p>With that, you're partnered with our <b>highly skilled team</b> of developers.</p>
      <p>There are <b>no headaches</b> for you to waste your time on.</p>
      <h3>Why should you work with us?</h3>
