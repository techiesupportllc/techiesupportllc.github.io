## Setting the Stage

If you’re a business owner, picking the right platform for your website is confusing.  It seems like there are about 100,000 different options out there.  Every one of them says they're the best, the cheapest, the fastest, you name it.  Maybe you ask a tech-savvy friend for some advice.  What do they tell you?

*"Just use WordPress."*

## The Situation

It's true; a massive percentage of business websites use WordPress.  We can make some educated guesses as to why this is:

- WordPress has great brand recognition.
- Every web developer is at least familiar with it.
- It has a ton of available themes and extensions.

So far, so good.

We're not bashing WordPress or saying that it absolutely *shouldn’t* be used ever.  But it does have its fair share of drawbacks.  Ultimately, these boil down to **poor speed** and **lackluster security**.  Before the WordPress fans converge on us, it's worth pointing out that these issues can be mitigated with the right combination of hosting, content delivery and extensions -- emphasis on *can be*.

Here's what we've observed:

1.  Businesses often hire web developers based solely on price, and those developers are often lacking experience in the optimal way to set up WordPress.
2.  A large majority of businesses opt not to pay their web developer to maintain their WordPress site, and they rarely take the time to do so themselves.
3.  Most business websites go months or years between updates, and they're essentially online "brochures" advertising the business' services.

## The Better Way

We won't touch WordPress with a 10-foot pole, as the old saying goes.  Why?

**Because there's a better way.**

We build our sites using cutting-edge technologies and modern workflows -- the *JAMstack*.  This translates to a smoother, faster and more efficient development process which in turn correlates to better performance, lower cost and greater scalability for your website.

It's a bold move in the web development community to completely avoid WordPress projects.  But it's part of what makes us **radically different** from the competition.  And ultimately, we do it because we firmly believe it's in your best interests to do so.

So please, *don't* just use WordPress.
