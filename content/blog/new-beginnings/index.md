## The Harsh Reality

After a long hiatus, Techie Support is back!  We were founded back in 2013 to provide (perhaps a little too) affordable IT support services for small businesses.  That led to modest success in the local Phoenix market, but here's the reality:

**When you stand in the middle of the road, you get ran over.**

We were too focused on trying to do everything under the sun instead of focusing on specializing and getting really, really, ridiculously good at one specific area of IT.  And when you have a small team, you can't realistically compete with the big boys who have the resources and manpower to devote to doing a lot of things pretty well.

## The Bright Future

So we took a break, regrouped and refocused on web development.  But folks, we don't do just *any* web development here.  We do **radically different** web development.  It's going to be a fun run.
