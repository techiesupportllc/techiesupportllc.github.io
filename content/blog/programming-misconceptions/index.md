## Misconceptions

What do you think of when you hear the word "programming"?

We've observed three major misconceptions that most people seem to have about programming:

1.  You need to be awesome at math.
2.  You need to be a genius.
3.  You need to be a university graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science.

**Wrong!**

## Truth

What it boils down to is that programming is all about being stubborn.  We've met our fair share of stubborn people, and you probably have too.  You might even be one of them!

But why is stubbornnes important for programming?  Because it isn't something you learn overnight.  As a matter of fact, you won't even master it after spending several years attending university classes.  Instead, it's an ongoing craft that's honed and perfected on a daily basis.  All along the way you're going to run into inevitable problems that you'll need to doggedly push through.

The weak will give up, but *the stubborn will keep going*.

## Resources

Thankfully, we all have enough stubbornness in us to learn programming.  If you're fired up and ready to start learning, check out these three amazing resources for help:

1.  [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  This site will allow you to learn common languages like **HTML** and **CSS** and give you some challenging projects to work on.  You can even earn certifications to boost your resume or brag to your friends.  Best of all, it's all *100% free*!
2.  [**Codecademy**](https://www.codecademy.com/).  This site offers training in a wider array of languages, such as **Python**.  There aren't any certifications to earn, but it's still a solid resource that you should check out.  Again, it's all *100% free*!
3.  [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  This site has a fantastic web development curriculum and even helps to teach you how to get hired in a programming role.  You should be expecting this by now, but this one is also *100% free*!

With the right resources and enough stubbornness (maybe *persistence* is a better word choice), anyone can learn programming.  If you've been thinking about taking the plunge, there's no better time than the present.
