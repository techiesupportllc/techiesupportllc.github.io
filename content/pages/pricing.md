Title:  Pricing

Our pricing is simple and straightforward.

# Rate

All content I produce is billed at a flat rate of $1 per word.  

# Terms

Once we settle on a rough length for your piece of content and the contract has been signed, you'll be required to pay 50% up front.

I say "rough length" because while an order may be placed for a 1000-word piece of content, for example, it is often necessary to trim a few words from or add a few words to the total count to make the piece flow well.

After the content is finished and the final word count is calculated, the final file will be delivered to you along with the invoice for the remaining amount due.  

All final invoices are due upon receipt.
